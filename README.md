# ChatReply

## Example usage
Run the command and pipe input into its _stdin_

_Tip: By default the messages are splitted by newline character_  
_(In the example the '\\' is used to escape '!' symbol)_
```bash
echo "React to this message\!
 This is a second message" | go run chatreply.go
```

Bot starts to watching for reaction on the messages (indicated by the eyes emoji)

Upon reacting to a message the eyes emoji dissapears  
_Tip: Both emoji reactions and text responses are supported_

And original messages including the replies are outputed to _stdout_ in real time (once the program sees the reply)
